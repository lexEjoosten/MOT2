# MOT2
 2nd MOT Model.
 
 The aim of this model is to provide a full and flexible toolkit for modelling Magneto Optical Traps in an efficient and parallelized manner. 
 
 This toolkit needs to be able to take account of, alongside the standard fare for MOT's:
 
 - Multi-level systems, including repump.
 
 - Mid-simulation Changing environmental conditions, such as a changing magnetic field, or a changing incident light.

 - Mid-simulation addition of atoms.

 - Multiple-species of atoms.

 - Interactions between atoms (radiation pressure).

 - Stochastic heating from spontaneous emission of photons.

 - And More.
