Found website for calculating transition strengths:

May try to implement this programatically, if I can find a library of calculating 3J & 6J.
There is the pyshtools library which has wigner 3J symbols. For now I will include those manually


the polarization rotation will still be done using the axis angle representation, as this is easiest.
